# ðŸ“š Online Bookstore SQL Project

Project Title: Online Bookstore Analysis<br>
Level: Beginner<br>
Database: `onlinebookstore`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze online bookstore data. The project involves setting up a bookstore database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL.

# Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and manage missing or incorrect values in the dataset.<br>
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory queries to understand books, customers, and orders.<br>
3. **Business Anaysis**: Use SQL to answer business-driven questions like sales trends, best-selling books, and customer insights.

# Project Structure

***1. Database Setup***<br>
***Database Creation:*** Create a database named onlinebookstore.<br>
```sql
-- create database
create database onlinebookstore;

-- switch to the database
\c onlinebookstore;
```
***2. Table Creation: Create three tables:***<br>
***Books:*** Stores book details such as title, author, genre, published year, price, and stock.<br>
```sql
-- create tables
drop table if exists books;
create table books (
    book_id serial primary key,
    title varchar(100),
    author varchar(100),
    genre varchar(50),
    published_year int,
    price numeric(10, 2),
    stock int
);
```
***Customers:*** Contains customer details such as name, email, phone, city, and country.<br>
```sql
drop table if exists customers;
create table customers (
    customer_id serial primary key,
    name varchar(100),
    email varchar(100),
    phone varchar(15),
    city varchar(50),
    country varchar(150)
);
```
***Orders:*** Records customer purchases including order date, quantity, and total amount.
```sql
drop table if exists orders;
create table orders (
    order_id serial primary key,
    customer_id int references customers(customer_id),
    book_id int references books(book_id),
    order_date date,
    quantity int,
    total_amount numeric(10, 2)

select * from books;
select * from customers;
select * from orders;

);
```
# 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning<br>

1. ***Record Count:*** Count total books, customers, and orders.<br>
2. ***Distinct Values:*** Identify unique genres in the books dataset.<br>
3. ***Null Value Check:*** Check for missing values in books, customers, and orders.<br>

# 3. Data Analysis & Findings<br>
   
The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:<br>

1) ***Retrieve all books in the "fiction" genre:***<br>
```sql   
select * from books
where genre = 'fiction';
```
2) ***Find books published after the year 1950:***<br>
```sql    
select * from books
 where published_year > 1950;
```
3) ***List all customers from the canada:***<br>
```sql    
select * from customers
where country = 'canada';
```
4) ***How orders placed in november 2023:***<br>
```sql    
select * from orders
where order_date between '2023-11-01' and '2023-11-30';
```
5) *** Retrieve the total stock of books available:***
```sql    
select sum(stock) as total_stocks
from books;
```
6) ***Find the details of the most expensive book:***
```sql    
select * from books
order by price desc limit 1;
```
7) ***Show all customers who ordered more than 1 quantity of a book:***
```sql    
select * from orders
where quantity > 1; 
```
8) ***Retrieve all orders where the total amount exceeds $20:***
```sql    
select * from orders
where total_amount > 20;
```
9) ***List all genres available in the books table:***
```sql     
select distinct genre from books;
```
10) ***Find the book with the lowest stock:***
```sql     
select * from books
order by stock limit 10;
```
11) ***Calculate the total revenue generated from all orders:***
```sql     
select sum(total_amount) as total_revenue
from orders;
```
12) ***Retrieve the total number of books sold for each genre:***
```sql     
select b.genre , sum(o.quantity) as total_books_sold
from orders o
join books b on c.book_id = b.book_id
group by b.genre;
```

13) ***Find the average price of books in the "fantasy" genre:***
```sql     
select avg(price) as avg_price
from books
where genre = 'fantasy';
```
14) ***List customers who have placed at least 2 orders:***
```sql     
select o.customer_id, c.name, count(o.order_id) as order_count
from orders o
join customers c on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
group by o.customer_id, c.name
having count(order_id) >= 2;
```
15) ***Find the most frequently ordered book:***
```sql     
select o.book_id,b.title, count(o.order_id) as orderd_books

order by orderd_books
desc
limit 1;
```

desc;
```
18) ***List the cities where customers who spent over $30 are located:***

select distinct o.customer_id, c.name, sum(o.total_amount) as most_spend
from orders o
join customers c on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
group by o.customer_id,c.name
order by most_spend
desc
limit 1;
```
20) ***Calculate the stock remaining after fulfilling all orders:***
```sql 
select b.book_id, b.title, b.stock, coalesce(sum(o.quantity),0) as total_quantity,
b.stock - coalesce(sum(o.quantity),0) as remaining_quantity
from books b
left join orders o on b.book_id = o.book_id
group by b.book_id
order by b.book_id;
```
